# Does drip irrigation or periodic watering provide the best amount of water to plants?
# Hypothesis 
## Drip irrigation provides the best amount of water for unattended watering of potted plants.

# Theory
1. Plant growth factors
   * **Photosynthesis** - The process of converting energy from light into sugar, in the presence of chlorophyll using carbon dioxide and water
   * **Respiration** - The process of burning sugars using oxygen to get energy for growth, and life
   * **Transpiration** - The process of transporting nutrients using water from the soil through roots
2. Plants need Air (Carbon dioxide and Oxygen), Water, Sunlight, and Nutrients to survive and grow
3. Potted plans need to be watered regularly to survive

# Procedure
1. Prepare materials and equipment
   * Select two potted plants of the same kind and size
   * 2 empty 1-gallon milk cans, plastic tubes, small valve, toy pump
   * Equipment needed – moisture sensor, timer, and kitchen scale
   * Place the 2 potted plants side by side such that they would get the same amount of sunlight
2. Drip Irrigation Setup
   * Fill the milk cans with water, make a small hole in the bottle cap for the tube, and insert the plastic tube through the hole
   * Place the milk can in an elevated position relative to the pot and adjust the valve such that 20 drops of water flow in 10 minutes
   * Insert the moisture sensor into the soil
3. Periodic Watering Setup
   * Fill the milk cans with water, make a small hole in the bottle cap for the tube, and insert the plastic tube through the hole
   * Make sure that the pump reaches the bottom of the can
   * Place the milk can at the same level as the pot
   * Adjust the timer such that 150 ml of water is delivered by the pump every day (Turn on the pump for about 10 seconds per day)
4. Allow the 2 watering systems to run for 3 days and adjust the systems if needed until they work reliably
5. Measure the maximum, minimum, and average moisture levels of the 2 plants daily. Take multiple readings to arrive at the average. Record your observation in a table. In the test setup, the microcontroller took hundreds of readings every minute.
6. Measure the amount of water dispensed using the kitchen scale. Find the difference in the weight of milk cans between the present and the previous day to calculate the ml of water delivered to the plants. Record your observation in a table. 
7. Continue the experiment for 21 days.

# Observations
* Plants grown under infrared light or darkness were yellow and looked more like sprouts than plants, they did not have any leaves
* Plants grown under white, blue, and ultraviolet light had lush green leaves and could support their weight on their own
* Light sources used in the experiment were not monochromatic as other colors can be seen under spectroscope

# Conclusions
## Drip irrigation provides the best amount of water for unattended watering of potted plants.
* Drip irrigation: Simple setup, cost-effective, saves water, but it may not be suitable for all types of plants.
* Periodic watering system: Hard to setup, expensive, and wastes water, but it can be adjusted for all types of plants.
* A periodic drip irrigation system could achieve the merits of the periodic watering system and still save water.

# Does the color of light affect a plant’s growth? Is pink light the best color for plants to grow fast?
## Dependent Measure: Height of the Plant
## Independent Variable: Light Color

# Hypothesis 
## I think light's color affects plant growth, and 'white' light is the best for plants to grow fast.

# Theory - Plants and Photosynthesis
1. Plants use the process of Photosynthesis to prepare food
2. Photosynthesis depends on the absorption of light by the pigments in their leaves (Chlorophyll-a, Chlorophyll-b, and Beta-Carotene)
3. The rate of absorption in plants changes with the wavelength of light
4. Only the Red and Blue ends of the light spectrum are used by most plants during photosynthesis
5. This is why the color of the leaf is green to our eyes (as it is reflected)
6. When plants are grown under artificial lights, red and blue colored lights are usually used to save electricity

# Theory - Electromagnetic Spectrum
1. Visible light is a small part of the Electromagnetic Spectrum
2. Light travels through space as a wave, and the distance between two wave peaks is the wavelength of that beam of light
3. Wavelength determines the color of the light
4. A simple homemade spectroscope can help to view the spectrum of incident light

# Procedure
1. Prepare materials and equipment
  * Cardboard boxes with dividers, 10 small plastic bags (air pillows cut in half), wheat grass seeds, soil and water
  * Equipment needed – Different color light sources (White, Infra Red, Ultra Violet-A, Red, Blue, Green), Electronic circuit for controlling the brightness of the light sources, Cell phone charger, Mains timer and tape measure 
2. Initial experiment setup
  * Fill 10 plastic bags with adequate soil and plant 5 wheat grass seeds each and water them
  * Place each bag with soil and seeds in one of the divided areas of the cardboard box and make sure that no external light can enter the box
  * Make holes for the light sources at the top of the box for each of the divided areas and install the lights
  * Connect the cell phone charger to the timer and set the timer to be ‘ON’ for 12 hours a day
3. Monitor the box daily to see whether the seeds germinate and water them if needed
4. When plants start to germinate, record the height of the plants under each light color using the tape measure in centimeters
5. Continue to record the height of the plants daily for 10 days and water them if needed

# Observations
* Plants grown under infrared light or darkness were yellow and looked more like sprouts than plants, they did not have any leaves
* Plants grown under white, blue, and ultraviolet light had lush green leaves and could support their weight on their own
* Light sources used in the experiment were not monochromatic as other colors can be seen under spectroscope

# Conclusions
## My hypothesis that white light is the best for plants to grow is correct.
* Plants can also grow well in Blue, Red, and Red+Blue color lights
* LED is not an ideal monochromatic light source as I could observe the presence of other colors using the spectroscope.  
* If only an artificial light source is available, we could use a combination of Red and Blue colors instead of white light to save electrical power.

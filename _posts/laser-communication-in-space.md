# Problem Statement
The amount of data people are using is growing exponentially with new tools for sifting through vast swaths of data emerging. Following this trend, scientists are requiring ever-increasing amounts of information from space for their research. However, space communication technologies are struggling to keep up. For example, the 2020 Mars Rover, Perseverance, can receive 10 to 30 bits of data per second with its specialized low-gain antenna. The rover can receive communications from a base station on Earth for roughly 8 minutes each Martian day. This amounts to 0.6 kB to 1.8 kB of data received per Martian day. For comparison, the image below is roughly 60 kB. This means the rover, which cost over $2 billion to build, will, in the worst case, take 100 days to receive a simple image. With scientists and engineers requiring an increasing amount of data to be transferred, the current means of communication will prove ineffective.
